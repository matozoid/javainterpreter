# Java Interpreter

This is just a little project to see if it is easy to create a Java interpreter on top of JavaParser.
It is far from finished, and I won't finish it.
So, yeah, I guess it is possible, but it isn't easy, just because building an interpreter is not easy.
JavaParser itself is very helpful.
